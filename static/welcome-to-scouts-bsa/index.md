## What Is Scouting?

<table><tr><td>

</td></tr></table>

Notes:

Started in London. Robert Baden-Powell published a series of booklets that established games and practices to make youth more fit for adventure and leadership. He thought of this program for years after trying to handle improperly trained recruits in the military.

Notes:

Turn of century had YMCA had camps, the Tribe of Woodland Indians boys' organization from Ernest Thompson Seton, and the Sons of Daniel Boone from Daniel Carter Beard. They were brought together by William Boyce, who was inspired by an unknown Scout in London. Boyce combined these into the BSA.

<!-- .element: style="background-color: lightblue; border: .04em solid navy; font-size: 0.8em; width: 60%; margin: 0.5em auto" -->

Notes:

Chartered organization owns everything that the troop owns.

----

## Aims

* Character development
* Leadership development
* Citizenship training
* Personal fitness (physical, mental, emotional)

----

## Methods

* Ideals (Oath, Law, Motto, Slogan)
* Patrols
* Outdoor programs
* Advancement
* Association with Adults
* Personal Growth
* Leadership Development
* Uniform

Notes:

75% of Scouting is outing. // Surmountable obstacles in a safe environment. // Adults are positive role models.

Doing a Good Turn helps others, but also improves yourself by building good character.

Uniform creates a positive image in the community and shows commitment to the program.

----

## Uniforms

<table><tr><td width="45%">

![](scout-uniform-new.png)

</td><td>

![](class-b.jpg)

</td></tr></table>

Notes:

No official requirement. Troop expectations.

Field Uniform / Class A - Shirt and all patches, belt, pants, socks. Merit badge sash only for formal events. Activity Uniform / Class B - dark blue shirt or hoodie, used when we're working or while at camp.

## Getting Started

* Finish paperwork, pay dues
* Medical forms (Sections A, B, C)
* Scout uniform, patches, and numbers
* Scout handbook
* Get involved with the leadership
* Watch your child grow! *(It's hard!)*

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="step-back.jpg" -->

## Seeking Assistance

Scout asks the Patrol Leader

Patrol Leader asks the Senior Patrol Leader

Senior Patrol Leader asks the Scoutmaster or an Assistant Scoutmaster

----

## It's Time to Let Go

You want to help out, pass a message, or assist somehow. Talk to the Scoutmaster or an Assistant Scoutmaster. They will relay the information.

It's hard to watch kids struggling, but they are safe and will learn much more doing it themselves.

Notes:

Send messages through the Scoutmaster or Assistant Scoutmaster or let the youth figure it out themselves. The Scouts are in great hands.

If it's sensitive, the Scoutmaster or the Assistant Scoutmaster will go to the child directly.

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="character-training.jpg" -->

----

## When Should I Step In?

If it is a safety issue, step in immediately. This includes any form of bullying, hazing, profanity, or the threat of physical harm.
<!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

Otherwise, let them learn.

Notes:

It's hard, but your children will learn, advance, and become more independent faster. They will gain the most benefit from the Scouting program.

Go do it!
