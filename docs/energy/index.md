Notes:

This also means you should follow along and know what question we are discussing.

---

## What is "Energy?"

----

### Definitions

**energy**: power derived from the utilization of physical or chemical resources, especially to provide light and heat or to work machines.

**energy**: the property of matter and radiation which is manifest as a capacity to perform work (such as causing motion or the interaction of molecules).

----

### Examples of Energy

What examples can you provide?

<table><tr><td width="50%">

</td></tr>

----

Batteries - chemical energy converted to electricity

Solar panels - light (photons) transmitting through space and air to solar panels (radiant) and converted to electricity

Fire - chemical reaction that produces heat and light

Dropping a book - Gravitational energy causes the book to move down and landing will cause a shockwave plus generate sound

## Requirement 4

Conduct an energy audit of your home. Keep a 14-day log that records what you and your family did to reduce energy use. Include the following in your report and, after the 14-day period, discuss what you have learned with your counselor.

----

a. List the types of energy used in your home such as electricity, wood, oil, liquid petroleum, and natural gas, and tell how each is delivered and measured, and the current cost; OR record the transportation fuel used, miles driven, miles per gallon, and trips using your family car or another vehicle.

----

b. Describe ways you and your family can use energy resources more wisely. In preparing your discussion, consider the energy required for the things you do and use on a daily basis (cooking, showering, using lights, driving, watching TV, using the computer). Explain what is meant by sustainable energy sources. Explain how you can change your energy use through reuse and recycling.

---

## Requirement 5

## Requirement 7

Tell what is being done to make FIVE of the following energy systems produce more usable energy. In your explanation, describe the technology, cost, environmental impacts, and safety concerns.

----

### Biomass digesters or waste-to-energy plants

<img src="biomass.png" style="float: left">

Waste decomposes and slowly produces methane. Low cost, low impact. Maintenance is difficult because the gas is lethal.

----

### Cogeneration plants

Generate both usable heat and electricity; typically burns natural gas. Moderate cost, and larger facilities are more efficient. Releases greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels, but getting more out of them by producing two usable outputs. Risk of explosions, fire, electrocution.

----

### Fossil fuel power plants

Generates electricity; typically burns coal. Moderate cost, and larger facilities are more efficient. Releases greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels. Risk of fire, electrocution.

----

### Fuel cells

<img src="fuel-cell.jpg" style="float: left" />

Turns hydrogen atoms into water by combining them with oxygen. Captures the electric charge that's created when the atoms are combined. Fairly high cost due to the materials involved. Much lower environmental impact. Hydrogen can explode.

----

### Geothermal power plants

Uses the heat of the planet to produce steam, which rotates a turbine to generate electricity. Initial cost is moderate to high, but it's inexpensive to run. When not managed correctly, ground temperatures can be lowered or polluted water can be pushed into the system. Steam pressure can violently rupture, potential for electrocution and it's worsened by the presence of water.

----

### Nuclear power plants

Heat from splitting atoms is used to boil water and turn a turbine to create electricity. Initial cost is extremely high, though operational cost is low. The waste products are small, but stay radioactive for very long time and need to be stored carefully. Lots of potential danger from radiation and the splitting of atoms, though the technology is safer than coal, petroleum, or natural gas.

----

### Solar power systems

Photons excite atoms in layers of silicon, producing an electrical charge. Cost is moderate and falling rapidly. Production of solar cells can produce toxins and uses a lot of energy, though new technology is reducing the environmental impact. Risk of electrocution.

----

### Tidal energy, wave energy, or ocean thermal energy conversion devices

<img src="tidal.jpg" style="float: left" />

The motion of the waves turn turbines to generate electricity. Cost is moderate due to the difficulty of construction at sea. Environmental impact is being researched, mostly seems to affect marine life. Risk of electrocution made a bit worse by the presence of water.

----

### Wind turbines

Wind pushes turbines to generate electricity. Cost is moderate. Blades have a very limited lifespan and can't be reused, plus birds can be killed when flying too close to the blades. Risk of electrocution.

---

## Requirement 8

Find out what opportunities are available for a career in energy. Choose one position that interests you and describe the education and training required.

---

### Requirement 1b

After you have completed requirements 2 through 8, revisit your source for requirement 1a. Explain to your counselor what you have learned in completing the requirements that helps you better understand the article.

---
