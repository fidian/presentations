## What is Pioneering?

Can anyone here define it?

Why does the BSA continue to promote it since its start in 1911?

Notes:

Problem solving skills, teamwork.

## Dictionary Definition

> (adj) involving new ideas or methods. "his pioneering work on consciousness"

> (adj) relating to or being a pioneer, especially characteristic of early settlers or their time.

----

## Wikipedia: Pioneering (scouting)

The art of using ropes and wooden spars joined by lashings and knots to create a structure, from camp gadgets to bridges and towers.

Name comes from 18th and 19th century military engineers who went ahead of an army to "pioneer" a route, which could involve building bridges and towers with rope and timber.

---

## Safety (Part 1)

1a: Explain to your counselor the most likely hazards you might encounter while participating in pioneering activities and what you should do to anticipate, help prevent, mitigate, and respond to these hazards.

----

## Safety (Part 2)

1b: Discuss the prevention of, and first aid treatment for, injuries and conditions that could occur while working on pioneering projects, including rope splinters, rope burns, cuts, scratches, insect bites and stings, hypothermia, dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke, sunburn, and falls.

----

## Guide to Safe Scouting

Pioneering projects, such as monkey bridges, have a maximum height of 6 feet. Close supervision should be followed when Scouts are building or using pioneering projects.

Safe Swim Defense applies to other nonswimming activities whenever participants enter water over knee deep or when submersion is likely, for example, when fording a stream, seining for bait, or constructing a bridge as a pioneering project.

---

## Pay Attention to Details

People get knots wrong all the time.

Even experts.

It's okay.

Be patient. Take your time.

Carefully confirm each step.

----

It's okay to get things wrong!

> Wrong ≠ Bad <!-- .element: style="font-size: 2em" -->

You didn't succeed ***yet***.

Notes:

It took me until I was 15 until I understood it and stopped tying slipped granny knots.

## What can we learn?

1. Pay close attention.

2. Take your time.

3. Mistakes are okay.

## Rope Types

4: Explain the differences between synthetic ropes and natural-fiber ropes. Discuss which types of rope are suitable for pioneering work and why. Include the following in your discussion: breaking strength, safe working loads, and the care and storage of rope.

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="types-of-rope.jpg" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

Nylon stretches. Sisal kinks (super bad) when wet. Natural fibers swell and shrink when wet and may need to be stretched before use. Synthetics slip and different knots might need to be used. Polypropylene loses strength when exposed to the sun. Polyethylene develops permanent kinks. Cotton and jute are weaker than most others.

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="rope-comparison.png" data-background-size="contain" -->

Notes:

Nylon is a clear champion for most. Paracord and climbing ropes use sheathed nylon to combat two major weaknesses.
