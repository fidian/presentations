## Safety

1a: Show your counselor your current, up-to-date Cyber Chip.

1b: Discuss first aid prevention for potential injuries, such as eyestrain and repetitive stress injuries, that could occur during programming activities.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Cyber Chip

There is a section at the end of the presentation that should help you get started with this requirement.

It is beyond the scope of this class. You must do some work with your Scoutmaster and parents or guardians.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Potential Injuries

Can you think of anything harmful for your body during programming?

What about harm to others?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Eye Strain

* "Fatigue of the eyes"
* Take breaks
* Work in a well-lit room
* Minimize glare
* Blink more
* Exercise eyes
* Look at distant objects

<aside class="notes"><p>Show difference between glare and anti-glare monitors.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Repetitive Stress Injuries

* "Too much stress on a part of the body, resulting in inflammation, muscle strain, tissue damage"
* Carpal tunnel syndrome is one example
* Use good posture when sitting
* Loosen shoulders and use a light touch on your keyboard
* Clair and desk should allow 90° angles at knees, hips, elbows
* Take frequent breaks

<aside class="notes"><p>Show keyboard size differences and what an ergonomic keyboard can look like.</p>

# Other Injuries

* Electrical shock when working directly on circuits
* Cuts from sharp edges within computers
* Headaches from flickering lights, especially fluorescent bulbs
* Job stress

### Programmed Devices Can Malfunction

Medical devices have been known to crash, endangering a patient's life.

Self-driving cars can still get into accidents.

Power grids have been hacked. If done during a heat wave, people could die.

Cell phones can start on fire.

<aside class="notes"><p>This only covers physical injuries. What about stolen information, leaked pictures, hacked webcams?</p>

### Ada Lovelace

Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron) published the first program in 1843 for Charles Babbage's "analytical engine". The analytical engine was never made.

### Konrad Zuse

Tired of using a mechanical adding machine, Konrad built the first general-purpose computer in 1941 after 6 years of work. The computer was programmed with a variant of binary. He also designed the first high level programming language, Plankalkül.

The Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator was created by J. Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly in 1945. A lightning strike destroyed it a decade later.

It is estimated ENIAC ran more calculations than all humankind did up to that point.

### ML

This programming language had the first polymorphic type system.

Before:

response.send(12345);

## Intellectual Property

4a: Explain the four types of intellectual property used to protect computer programs.

4b: Describe the difference between licensing and owning software.

4c: Describe the differences between freeware, open source, and commercial software, and why it is important to respect the terms of use of each.

<aside class="notes"><p>Bucky recommends notes and requires active participation in class discussion as well as being able to satisfy the counselor of their understanding of each.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Intellectual Property Protection

**Copyright** - Exclusive legal right granted to the originator to print, publish, perform, film, record material and to authorize others

**Patents** - Exclude others from making, using, selling an invention

**Trademarks** - Symbol or words registered to represent a company or product

**Trade Secrets** - Secret device or technique used by a company

<aside class="notes"><p>Copyright applies to basically any written or printed work, like books.</p>
<p>Patents apply to processes, like new ways to create medicines.</p>
<p>Trademarks are for symbols.</p>
<p>Trade secrets are not really protected by law, like the secret recipe for Coca-Cola.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Licensing - vs - Ownership

<table><tr><td width="50%">

Legal contract governing the use or redistribution of software, granting specific copyright privileges.

Controls what can happen after the sale.

</td><td>

May legally use the software without a license from the software publisher or developer.

Does not govern what happens after the sale.

</td></tr></table>
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Is Software Licensed?

When something is licensed, it is allowed specific privileges under copyright law, such as making a backup copy to place into storage.

Software "Terms of Use" can prohibit making any copies and restrict other privileges.

When you license software, a contract is agreed upon.

<aside class="notes"><p>Does purchasing software automatically agree to the software&#39;s terms?</p>
<p>Software licenses specifically prohibit making backup copies, yet copyright law calls out that backups can be made.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Is Software Owned?

One is allowed to resell owned products, take them apart, and inspect them after the purchase.

The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) prevents copying and hacking software, decompiling, and reverse engineering how it works.

If you truly owned software, the DMCA couldn't apply.

<aside class="notes"><p>Video game developers vs bots. Explain how bots/hacks cheat and ruin the experience for legit players. DMCA lawsuits have been won against hackers, indicating software is not owned.</p>
<p>Reselling software keys is legal as long as only one person is using the key.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Is software licensed or owned?

This is a very strongly debated topic.

What do you think? Do you own the software or do you have permission to use the software?
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Software Licenses

**Freeware** costs nothing. Can still place limits, such as for personal use, the number of users, certain features.

**Shareware** asks people to pay. Often uses the honor system to cover development cost.

**Demo** software works for a limited time and then the user must pay a fee.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Software Licenses

**Open Source** typically is a form of freeware, but also allows people access to the source code, which is the human-readable version of the program before compiling.

**Commercial Software** is where you must buy a license in order to use it. Most purchased software is commercial.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Projects

5a: With your counselor's approval, choose a sample program. Modify the code or add a function or subroutine to it. Debug and demonstrate the modified program to your counselor.

### Fix a Bug
