2: Do the following:

2a: Discuss with your counselor the aspects of emergency preparedness: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, recovery.

Include in your discussion the kinds of questions that are important to ask yourself as you consider each of these.

----

## Prevention

Avoiding the problem is the safest course of action.

Notes:

Safety First

----

## Protection

Make a plan and practice it.

Make a kit and ensure it's ready.

Warning devices.

Notes:

Smoke detectors are warning devices.

----

## Mitigation

Lessen the impact of the next emergency by taking action now.

This class can be seen as mitigation for people who are not prepared, or protection as a review of what you already have on place.

Mitigation is often done after an event, but can be done in advance.

----

## Response

STOP: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan

First Aid.

Focus on your task.

Notes:

Avoid chaos and panic. Speak clearly. Ensure people know what's going on and direct them to best help the situation.

Rebuild, repair, heal, console.

---

## Planning and Aspects
