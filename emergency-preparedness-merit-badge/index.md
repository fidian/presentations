<!-- .element style="color: red" -->

---

## Expectations

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="on-my-honor-coin.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->

## Scout-Like Behavior
<!-- .element: style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)" -->

Respectful and engaged, otherwise you will be asked to leave.
<!-- .element: style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)" -->

----

## Like College, Not High School

With college, you pay the instructor to teach. It's up to the student to learn.

----

## Not Prepared?

It's okay. Let me know, I make a note, and we will simply move on.

I'll try to help achieve as many requirements as possible.

<img src="unprepared.jpg">

----

## Action Verb

Each requirement has action verbs. "Describe," "prepare," "report," "interview," and other actions need to be performed.

Requirements must be met word for word.

----

## Ethics

Scouts are expected to have done their own work. It is immoral to claim another person's work as your own. This includes:

* Making your own kit instead of entirely relying on a pre-made emergency kit.

* Writing your own words for the chart in 2C, not copying and pasting. Or you can explain each section in your own words.

----

## Participation Is Expected

## Planning and Aspects

2: Do the following:

2a: Discuss with your counselor the aspects of emergency preparedness: prevention, protection, mitigation, response, recovery.

Include in your discussion the kinds of questions that are important to ask yourself as you consider each of these.

----

## Prevention

Avoiding the problem is the safest course of action.

Notes:

Safety First

----

## Protection

Make a plan and practice it.

Make a kit and ensure it's ready.

Warning devices.

Notes:

Smoke detectors are warning devices.

----

## Mitigation

We will come back to this.

----

## Response

STOP: Stop, Think, Observe, Plan

First Aid.

Focus on your task.

Notes:

Avoid chaos and panic. Speak clearly. Ensure people know what's going on and direct them to best help the situation.

----

## Recovery

Get back to normal.

Rebuild, repair, heal, console.

----

## Mitigation

Lessen the impact of the next emergency by taking action now.

It's **taking an action** to see if you can improve any of the other four aspects.

Notes:

Taking this class can be seen as a mitigation step. Checklists, audits, and annual reviews are also mitigation steps.

The important part is that it is an action you are taking.

---

## Planning and Aspects

2: Do the following:

2b: Using a chart, graph, spreadsheet, or another method approved by your counselor, demonstrate your understanding of each aspect of emergency preparedness listed in requirement 2a for 10 emergency situations from the list below. Discuss your findings with your counselor.

----

## Let's be REAL CLEAR

Using a chart, graph, spreadsheet, or another method <span style="background-color: yellow">approved by your counselor</span>, <span style="background-color: orange">demonstrate your understanding</span> of each aspect of emergency preparedness listed in requirement 2a for 10 emergency situations from the list below. <span style="background-color: yellow">Discuss your findings</span> with your counselor.

----

## Ethics Again

All work needs to be your own. Don't try to claim someone else's worksheet chart as your own.

If you have any of the answers in this presentation, cross them out. You can recreate the chart and finish this merit badge after the class is over.

Alternately, you are able to explain each topic in your own words.

----

## Why Not Copy And Paste?

"Privilege escalation threat modeling revealed race conditions triggering edge-case memory overflows."

You can copy and paste it, but you that doesn't mean you can demonstrate your understanding of the words.

----

You must use these five situations. Discuss prevention, protection, mitigation, response, recovery.

1. Home kitchen fire
2. Home basement / storage room / garage fire
3. Explosion in the home
4. Automobile crash
5. Food-borne disease (food poisoning)

----

Pick 5 more from this list. Discuss prevention, protection, mitigation, response, recovery.

----

6. Fire or explosion in a public place <!-- .element: style="font-size: 0.80em" -->
7. Vehicle stalled in the desert <!-- .element: style="font-size: 0.80em" -->

Provides effective, cross-jurisdictional coordination.
