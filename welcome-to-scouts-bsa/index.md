Notes:

Started in London. Robert Baden-Powell published a series of booklets that established games and practices to make youth more fit for adventure and leadership. He thought of this program for years after trying to handle improperly trained recruits in the military.

Notes:

Chartered organization owns everything that the troop owns.

----

## Aims

* Character development
* Leadership development
* Citizenship training
* Personal fitness (physical, mental, emotional)

----

## Methods

* Ideals (Oath, Law, Motto, Slogan)
* Patrols
* Outdoor programs
* Advancement
* Association with Adults
* Personal Growth
* Leadership Development
* Uniform

Notes:

75% of Scouting is outing. // Surmountable obstacles in a safe environment. // Adults are positive role models.

Doing a Good Turn helps others, but also improves yourself by building good character.

Uniform creates a positive image in the community and shows commitment to the program.

----

## Uniforms

<table><tr><td width="45%">

![](scout-uniform-new.png)

</td><td>

![](class-b.jpg)

</td></tr></table>

Notes:

No official requirement. Troop expectations.

Field Uniform / Class A - Shirt and all patches, belt, pants, socks. Merit badge sash only for formal events. Activity Uniform / Class B - dark blue shirt or hoodie, used when we're working or while at camp.

Notes:

Each troop is unique, similar to how each family is different. We're covering how our troop wishes to implement the BSA's program.

----

## Getting Started

* Finish paperwork, pay dues
* Medical forms (Sections A, B, C)
* Scout uniform, patches, and numbers
* Scout handbook
* Get involved with the leadership
* Watch your child grow! *(It's hard!)*

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="step-back.jpg" -->

----

## Seeking Assistance

Scout asks the Patrol Leader

Patrol Leader asks the Senior Patrol Leader

Senior Patrol Leader asks the Scoutmaster or an Assistant Scoutmaster

----

## It's Time to Let Go

You want to help out, pass a message, or assist somehow. Talk to the Scoutmaster or an Assistant Scoutmaster. They will relay the information.

It's hard to watch kids struggling, but they are safe and will learn much more doing it themselves.

Notes:

Send messages through the Scoutmaster or Assistant Scoutmaster or let the youth figure it out themselves. The Scouts are in great hands.

If it's sensitive, the Scoutmaster or the Assistant Scoutmaster will go to the child directly.

----

<!-- .slide: data-background="character-training.jpg" -->

----

## When Should I Step In?

If it is a safety issue, step in immediately. This includes any form of bullying, hazing, profanity, or the threat of physical harm.
<!-- .element: style="color: red" -->

Otherwise, let them learn.

Notes:

It's hard, but your children will learn, advance, and become more independent faster. They will gain the most benefit from the Scouting program.

----

Here's how to get better.

Notes:

On campouts and during troop activities, you're now a mentor. Ask exploratory and probing questions to make them think.

## Camp Chair

Your new best friend.

Notes:

Scouts set up tents, dining fly, patrol box. Cook meals, clean up. Tend the fire and managing their time.

What do parents do? Great question. Mostly sit around and talk. Parents are observers. Leaders are mostly observers too.

## About the Program

----

## Ranks

![](ranks.gif)

----

## Advancement Goals

* Learning by doing
* Each child progresses at their own rate
* Encourage Scouting ideals
* Parents motivate, monitor, and support (not carry) the Scout

----

## Advancement Process

----

## Completing Requirements

Must be met <ins>exactly as written</ins>

Signed off by a senior Scout or an adult leader

No double-dipping

Notes:

Can't have anything count for two requirements of the same type.

Eg. A short hike for merit badge and rank, but not two merit badges nor two ranks. A long hike can be broken up and each chunk can count for different things.

----

## Rank Advancement

Skills or objectives change with each rank.

Three things are always included:

* Scout Spirit
* Scoutmaster Conference
* Board of Review

----

## Troop Structure

Youth-led troop and youth leadership positions

Patrols are ideally 6-8 youth

Adults facilitate

Notes:

The troop is a small democracy controlled by the youth in elected positions.

Patrols choose a name, a yell, and makes a flag. They camp, cook, clean, and go on activities together.
