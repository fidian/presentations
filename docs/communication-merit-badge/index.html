## Expectations

<!-- .slide: data-background="on-my-honor-coin.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->

## Scout-Like Behavior
<!-- .element: style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)" -->

Respectful and engaged, otherwise you will be asked to leave.

## Like College, Not High School

With college, you pay the instructor to teach. It's up to the student to learn.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Not Prepared?

It's okay. Let me know, I make a note, and we will simply move on.

I'll try to help achieve as many requirements as possible.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Action Verb

Each requirement has action verbs. "Describe," "prepare," "report," "interview," and other actions need to be performed.

Requirements must be met word for word.

## Participation Is Expected

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## Out Of Order

The requirements will be addressed out of order. This is intentional for the flow of the session.

It is not designed to be cruel to you, but you'll be jumping around your notes a bit.

(2) Do ONE of the following:
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(2b) Choose a concept, product, or service in which you have great confidence. Build a sales plan based on its good points. Try to persuade the counselor to agree with, use, or buy your concept, product or service. After your sales talk, discuss with your counselor how persuasive you were.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(2a) Think of a creative way to describe yourself using, for example, a collage, short story or autobiography, drawing or series of photographs, or a song or skit. Using the aid you created, make a presentation to your counselor about yourself.

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(4) Interview someone you know fairly well, like, or respect because of his or her position, talent, career, or life experiences. Listen actively to learn as much as you can about the person. Then prepare and deliver to your counselor an introduction of the person as though this person were to be a guest speaker, and include reasons why the audience would want to hear this person speak. Show how you would call to invite this person to speak.

</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(5) Attend a public meeting (city council, school board, debate) approved by your counselor where several points of view are given on a single issue. Practice active listening skills and take careful notes of each point of view. Prepare an objective report that includes all points of view that were expressed, and share this with your counselor.

(6) With your counselor's approval, develop a plan to teach a skill or inform someone about something. Prepare teaching aids for your plan. Carry out your plan. With your counselor, determine whether the person has learned what you intended.

(1) Do ONE of the following:
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(1a) For one day, keep a log in which you describe your communication activities. Keep track of the time and different ways you spend communicating, such as talking person-to-person, listening to teachers, listening to the radio or podcasts, watching television, using social media, reading books and other print media, and using any electronic communication device. Discuss with your counselor what your log reveals about the importance of communication in your life. Think of ways to improve your communication skills.

<!-- .element: style="font-size: 0.8em" -->

<p style="font-size: 0.8em">1. Obtain information<br>
2. Be persuaded<br>
3. Appreciate or enjoy something<br>
4. Understand someone's feelings</p>

<img src="homework-10.jpg" width="50%">
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(1c) In a small-group setting, meet with other Scouts or with friends. Have them share personal stories about significant events in their lives that affected them in some way. Take note of how each Scout participates in the group discussion and how effectively each Scout communicates their story. Report what you have learned to your counselor about the differences you observed in effective communication.

<aside class="notes"><p>Will likely do this in advance because otherwise this portion can take a long time.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(1d) List as many ways as you can think of to communicate with others (face-to-face, by telephone, letter, email, text messages, social media, and so on). For each type of communication, discuss with your counselor an instance when that method might not be appropriate or effective.

## Careers

<aside class="notes"><p>Scouts provide the three careers. Counselor guesses. If right, Scout explains everything. If wrong, Scout shows work and is done.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
(9) Find out about three career opportunities in communication. Pick one and find out the education, training, and experience required for this profession. Discuss this with your counselor, and explain why this profession might interest you.
