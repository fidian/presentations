## Like College, Not High School

With college, you pay the instructor to teach. It's up to the student to learn.

----

## Not Prepared?

It's okay. Let me know, I make a note, and we will simply move on.

I'll try to help achieve as many requirements as possible.

----

## Action Verb

Each requirement has action verbs. "Describe," "prepare," "report," "interview," and other actions need to be performed.

Requirements must be met word for word.

Scouts are expected to have done their own work. It is immoral to claim another person's work as your own.
